Dermatological Face Tracking
===
Features
---
Smooth webcam face tracking software for dermatological picture and video recording. The software enforces standardized lighting conditions and facial resolution before the picture/video can be taken.

Usage
---
```
python webcam.py
```
When lighting conditions are poor (too dark or too light) or the face is not at the right distance from the camera (too far or too close) it will be indicated at the bottom of the screen. After moving into optimal recording position, picture/video recording will begin after a three second countdown.
